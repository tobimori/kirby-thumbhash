---

ThumbHash is an image placeholder algorithm. Placeholders are represented by small ∼28 bytes hashes such as `1QcSHQRnh493V4dIh4eXh1h4kJUI`.
A demo and more information can be found on the [website](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/).

This plugin adds ThumbHash support to Kirby, allowing you to implement UX improvements such as progressive image loading or content-aware spoiler images like Mastodon.

Under the hood, the heavy work gets done by a PHP implementation of ThumbHash by [SRWieZ](https://github.com/SRWieZ): [SRWieZ/thumbhash](https://github.com/SRWieZ/thumbhash)
